.\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
pip install -r requirements.txt
python -m app.db.seed
python run.py
```

### macOS Terminal

## 9. Pre-Class Checklist

Please make sure all of the following work.

- Git is available
- Python 3 is available
- VS Code opens successfully
- Chrome opens successfully
- The repository can be cloned
- `pip install -r requirements.txt` completes
- `python -m app.db.seed` or `python3 -m app.db.seed` completes

## 10. Verification Commands

### Windows

```powershell
git --version

- On Windows, the PATH setting may not have been applied

### `pip install -r requirements.txt` fails

- Check your network connection
- Make sure the virtual environment is activated first

### `python run.py` does not start

- Run `python -m app.db.seed` or `python3 -m app.db.seed` first
- Save the full error message

---

## 12. Recommended Course Workflow

- Standardize on Chrome as the browser
