- Read the relationship between pages and routing in the code
- Understand the overall structure of the lab application used in later classes

---

# Topics for Today

1. Web application basics
2. HTTP basics
3. What Flask is
4. Getting the lab material from GitHub
5. Exploring the application in the browser
6. How to read the code
7. Exercises

---

# What Is a Web Application?

- The browser sends a request to the server
- The server processes the request and returns a result
- The browser displays the returned HTML

Example:

- Open `/login`
- Submit the login form
- The server authenticates the user and returns `/me`

---

# Important Terms

- Client:
  - The browser
- Server:
  - The Flask application
- Request:
  - A message sent from the browser
- Response:
  - A message returned by the server
- Routing:
  - The mechanism that selects code based on the URL

---

# Minimal HTTP Image

The browser opens a URL:

```text
GET /login HTTP/1.1
```

The server returns a page:

```text
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: text/html
```

Form submission:

```text
POST /login
```

---

# GET and POST

- `GET`
  - Used mainly for page display and data retrieval
  - Common when opening a URL
- `POST`
  - Used mainly for actions that change state
  - Login, logout, post creation, and similar actions

In today's app:

- `GET /login`
- `POST /login`
- `POST /logout`

---

# What Is Flask?

- A lightweight web framework for Python
- Lets us build web applications with a small amount of code
- Makes routing and templates relatively easy to understand
- Good for teaching because it is easier to see what is happening

In this course:

- We use Flask to read and run the lab application
- Then we build vulnerability exercises on top of it

---

# The Lab Application Used in This Course

This application will be used step by step throughout the course.

- Login
- Logout
- Authenticated pages
- User search
- Message board
- Profile update
- lab-settings

Today's focus:

- Being able to start the app
- Understanding how pages match the code

---

# Where to Get the Material

The lab material is provided through a public GitHub repository.

- Repository:
  - [https://github.com/koide55/LetureWebApp001](https://github.com/koide55/LetureWebApp001)

In class, we will clone this repository to the local machine.

---

# First Step

```bash
git clone https://github.com/koide55/LetureWebApp001.git
cd LetureWebApp001
```

After that, create the Python environment and start the application.

---

# Directory Structure

```text
LetureWebApp001/
  app/
    __init__.py
    routes.py
    templates/
    services/
    db/
  run.py
  requirements.txt
```

Important files:

- `run.py`: application entry point
- `app/__init__.py`: Flask application factory
- `app/routes.py`: page handlers
- `app/templates/`: HTML templates

---

# How to Start the Application

```bash
git clone https://github.com/koide55/LetureWebApp001.git
cd LetureWebApp001
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
python3 -m app.db.seed
python3 run.py
```

Open this in the browser:

- [http://127.0.0.1:5000](http://127.0.0.1:5000)

---

# Default Users

- `alice / alicepass`
- `bob / bobpass`
- `admin / adminpass`

Start by logging in as `alice`.

---

# First Hands-On

1. Clone the repository
2. Create a virtual environment
3. Install the dependencies
4. Run the seed command
5. Start the application
6. Open the top page
7. Log in with `alice / alicepass`
8. Open `My Page` and `Lab Settings`

What to observe:

- What each command is doing
- How the URL changes
- How each page has a different role
- How the behavior changes before and after login

---

# Code Entry Point 1
## `run.py`

```python
from app import create_app

app = create_app()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    app.run(debug=True)
```

Key points:

- `create_app()` creates the Flask application
- `app.run()` starts the development server

---

# Code Entry Point 2
## `app/__init__.py`

```python
def create_app(config_class=None):
    from flask import Flask
    from .config import Config
    from .routes import main_bp

    if config_class is None:
        config_class = Config

    app = Flask(__name__, instance_relative_config=True)
    app.config.from_object(config_class)
    app.register_blueprint(main_bp)
    return app
```

Key points:

- Creates the Flask application instance
- Loads configuration
- Registers routing

---

# Code Entry Point 3
## `app/routes.py`

```python
main_bp = Blueprint("main", __name__)

@main_bp.get("/")
def index():
    return render_template("index.html")
```

Key points:

- Accessing `"/"` runs `index()`
- It returns `index.html`
- The URL and the function correspond to each other

---

# How to Read Routing

Example:

```python
@main_bp.route("/login", methods=["GET", "POST"])
def login():
    ...
```

Meaning:

- It handles access to `/login`
- `GET` is used to display the page
- `POST` is used to process form submission

---

# The Role of Templates

`render_template("login.html")` returns HTML generated from
`app/templates/login.html`.

So:

- Python:
  - Handles the program flow
- HTML templates:
  - Handle the page layout and display

---

# Code Explanation
## `login.html`

```html
<form action="{{ url_for('main.login') }}" method="post" class="stack">
  <label for="username">Username</label>
  <input id="username" name="username" type="text" required>

  <label for="password">Password</label>
  <input id="password" name="password" type="password" required>

  <button type="submit">Login</button>
</form>
```

Key points:

- `form` defines a submission form
- `method="post"` sends the form using POST
- Names such as `username` are the keys used on the server side

---

# Form Submission and Server-Side Processing

```python
user, error, cookie_value = attempt_login(
    request.form.get("username", "").strip(),
    request.form.get("password", ""),
)
```

Key points:

- The server reads values from `request.form`
- Authentication happens on the server side
- Typing something into the form does not mean you are logged in yet

---

# Matching Pages and Code

By the end of today, you should be able to explain the following matches.

- Top page:
  - `index.html`
  - `index()`
- Login page:
  - `login.html`
  - `login()`
- My page:
  - `me.html`
  - `me()`

---

# What We Will Learn Later with This App

- Authentication
- Sessions
- Cookies
- SQL injection
- CSRF
- Reflected XSS
- Stored XSS
- Command injection
- Authorization issues

At this stage:

- It is more important to understand it first as a normal web application

---

# Exercise 1
## Clone the Repository and Start the App

Run the following commands.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/koide55/LetureWebApp001.git
cd LetureWebApp001
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
python3 -m app.db.seed
python3 run.py
```

Then open the top page in your browser.

---

# Exercise 2
## Check the Relationship Between Pages and URLs

Fill in the table below.

| Page | URL | Main role |
|---|---|---|
| Top page |  |  |
| Login |  |  |
| My Page |  |  |
| Profile |  |  |
| Board |  |  |
| Lab Settings |  |  |

---

# Exercise 3
## Find the Routing

Open `app/routes.py` and find the code for:

1. `/`
2. `/login`
3. `/me`
4. `/profile`
5. `/lab-settings`

Check:

- Which function handles it
- Whether it uses `GET` or `POST`
- Which template it returns

---

# Exercise 4
## Read the Templates

Open the following templates and compare them.

- `app/templates/base.html`
- `app/templates/login.html`
- `app/templates/me.html`

Look at:

- Navigation
- Forms
- The displayed data

---

# Exercise 5
## Follow the Code

Answer the following questions.

1. Where is the application created?
2. Where is the display logic for `/login`?
3. Where is the submission logic for `/login`?
4. Which template is used by `/me`?

---

# Exercise 6
## Check the Behavior

Try the following in the browser.

1. Open `/me` before logging in
2. Open `/me` after logging in
3. Open `Profile`
4. Open `Lab Settings`

Think about:

- What changes before and after login
- Why that change happens

---

# Summary of Today's Code Reading

- `run.py`
  - Entry point
- `app/__init__.py`
  - Application factory
- `app/routes.py`
  - Mapping between URLs and processing
- `app/templates/*.html`
  - Page structure and display

In short:

- A web app can be read through the relationship between URL, processing, and page

---

# Next Time

- How login and logout work
- The difference between authentication and authorization
- How protected pages are enforced

---

# Homework

1. Read `app/routes.py` and write down at least 5 URL-to-function mappings
2. Read `app/templates/base.html` and list the elements shared by all pages
3. Think about why `/login` uses both `GET` and `POST`

---

# Instructor Notes

- In the first lecture, do not go too deep into vulnerabilities yet
- Focus on understanding the app first as a normal web application
- If there is time, show form submission in browser developer tools
- Carefully connect `/login` and `/me` so the next lecture on authentication is easier
